# Art Generation

The notebook Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb generates an artistic version of the content image styled similar to a style image. The algorithm
uses Vgg16 architecture to train the pixels of a randomly generated image over a weighted sum of content_loss and style loss.

# Try your own images

- put your content image and style image in the working directory of the notebook
- in the notebook, change the path of the images, i.e. change the values of content_image_path and style_image_path to the path of your content image and style image
- Run all the cells of the notebook
